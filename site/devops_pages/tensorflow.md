# Tensorflow setup

This guid will walk you through the options to get up-and-running with Tensorflow. I will support three methods:

1. Vocareum (easy, no set-up, no GPU)
2. Google CoLab or Kaggle notebooks (easy, no set-up, limited free GPU)
3. Local using docker with NVIDIA/Tensorflow container (needs set-up, for folks with their own GPU)

## 1. Vocareum

Vocareum is pre-installed with Tensorflow 2.13 on python 3.10.

## 2. Google CoLab/Kaggle notebooks

Both work out-of-the box with pre-configured environments.

**CoLab**: Tensorflow 2.19, Python 3.12
**Kaggle**: Tensorflow 2.19, Python 3.12

## 3. Local Docker
