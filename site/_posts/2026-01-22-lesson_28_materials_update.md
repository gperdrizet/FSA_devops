The lesson 28 demo has been split into parts 1 & 2, both are available on the Jupyter notebooks page. Both the new tensorflow-CPU devcontainer and the tensorflow-GPU devcontainer now run TensorBoard by default on startup. They also publish port 6006 to the host system so you can access TensorBoard in you browser and include the TensorBoard VS Code extension.
