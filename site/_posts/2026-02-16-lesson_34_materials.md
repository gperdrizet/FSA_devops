The demo, activity and solution notebooks for lesson 34 are up. Note: I posted them as single notebooks on the Jupyter notebooks page, but the best way to find them is to visit my [`gperdrizet/RNNs`](https://github.com/gperdrizet/RNNs) repo. If you use the devcontainer environment set-up for you in that repo, the data acquisition and dependency installation will be handled for you. If you download the notebooks to your own environment, you will need to download the data from the datasets page and install the dependencies yourself.
