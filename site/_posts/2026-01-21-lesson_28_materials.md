The lesson 28 in-class demo and activity notebooks are up on the Jupyter notebooks page. I also added information about some options for running Tensorflow to the resources page. You can find the GitHub repository for the containerized TensorFlow-GPU development environment here: [gperdrizet/tensorflow-GPU](https://github.com/gperdrizet/tensorflow-GPU). Enjoy!
