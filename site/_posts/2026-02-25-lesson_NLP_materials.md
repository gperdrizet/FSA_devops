Lots of new stuff tonight! We will start unit 5: natural language processing today - so I added a [unit outline](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/resource_pages/nlp_unit_outline.html) to the resources page. This will hopefully give you some context and help make sense of the logical flow between individual lessons. Also, the course end capstone project will begin in about 1 month - so I added an [overview document](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/resource_pages/capstone_overview.html) which explains what the capstone project is and how we will prepare for 'build month' (April).
