As the course progresses and projects get more complex, we will start to move away from single notebooks and rely more on GitHub repositories. Here is the list for now

1. TensorFlow GPU development environment: [gperdrizet/tensorflow-GPU](https://github.com/gperdrizet/tensorflow-GPU)
2. TensorFlow CPU development environment: [gperdrizet/tensorflow-CPU](https://github.com/gperdrizet/tensorflow-CPU)
3. Weather API demo: [gperdrizet/weather](https://github.com/gperdrizet/weather)
4. Streamlit recommender app demo: [gperdrizet/anime-recommendations](https://github.com/gperdrizet/anime-recommendations)
